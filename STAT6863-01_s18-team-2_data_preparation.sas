*combine Police_Reports_2017 and Police_Reports_2016 horizontally using 
 proc sql;
*note: After running the proc sql step below several times and averaging
 the fullstimer output in the system log, they tend to take about 0.09
 seconds of "real time" to execute and about 9522.46k of memory on the computer
 they were tested on. Consequently, the proc sql step appears to be faster to 
 execute as the combined data step and proc sort steps above, but uses more
 memory;
proc sql;
    create table Police_Reports_1617_v2 as
	select
	    coalesce(A.Item_Number, B.Item_Number) as Item_Number
	from
	    Police_Reports_2017 as A
	    full join
	    Police_Reports_2016 as B
	    on A.Item_Number = B.Item_Number
	order by
            Item_Number
	;
quit;

*verify that Police_Reports_1617_v1 and Police_Reports_v2 are identical;
proc compare
        base = Police_Reports_1617_v1
        compare = Police_Reports_1617_v2
